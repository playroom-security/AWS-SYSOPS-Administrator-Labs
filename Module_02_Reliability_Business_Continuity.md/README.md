## Domain 2: Reliability and Business Continuity

## Task Statement 2:1: Implement scalability and elasticity

- Create and maintain AWS Auto Scaling plans. 
- Implement caching. 
- Implement Amazon RDS replicas and Amazon Aurora Replicas. 
- Implement loosely coupled architectures. 
- Differentiate between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling

## Task Statement 2.2: Implement high availability and resilient environments.

- Configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon Route 53 health checks. 
- Differentiate between the use of a single Availability Zone and Multi-AZ deployments (for example, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, ELB, Amazon FSx, Amazon RDS). 
- Implement fault-tolerant workloads (for example, Amazon Elastic File System [Amazon EFS], Elastic IP addresses). 
- Implement Route 53 routing policies (for example, failover, weighted, latency based)

## Task Statement 2.3: Implement backup and restore strategies. 

- Automate snapshots and backups based on use cases (for example, RDS snapshots, AWS Backup, RTO and RPO, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, retention policy). 
- Restore databases (for example, point-in-time restore, promote read replica). 
- Implement versioning and lifecycle rules. 
- Configure Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR). 
- Perform disaster recovery procedures
