## Amazon EventBridge: 

Formerly known as CloudWatch Events, EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to connect applications together using data from your own applications, integrated SaaS applications, and AWS services. It allows you to build event-driven architectures by routing events from sources to targets. For example, you can set up a rule to trigger a Lambda function when a specific event occurs in CloudWatch or another AWS service.
