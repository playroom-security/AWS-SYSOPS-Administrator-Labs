## AWS CloudTrail: 

CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It records API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers log files to an S3 bucket. 

This allows you to track user activity and API usage, providing a complete history of actions taken within your AWS environment.
